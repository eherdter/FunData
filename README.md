# FunData

A repository to store R scripts and Python Notebooks for data projects associated with the Udacity Data Analyst program.

## Contents:
1. A weather analysis.  
2. An exploration into GapMinder data.   
3. Analyzing A/B test results with bootstrap simulation and regression analysis.
4. An analysis of the WeRateDogs Twitter feed.
---------------

1. **weather_trends.Rmd** is a exploration into annual temperature in Miami, Florida. A moving average is used to compare annual temperature in Miami to the global average. The
data for this analysis is in _RawData_.   

2. **GDP_ChildMortality_FemaleEducation_GapMinder.ipynb** (in the _InvestigateGapMinder_ folder, with raw data) is a mini data exploration project using Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.   

3. **AnalyzeABtestResults.ipynb** (in the _AnalyzeABTestResults_ folder, with raw data) was an assignment where I was tasked to analyze some A/B testing data using bootstrap simulation hypothesis testing and regression methods. I used numpy, pandas, statsmodels.api, and patsy.

4. **wrangle_act.ipynb** (in the _WeRateDogs_Twitter_ folder, with raw data) was an assignment where I was tasked to address quality and tidyness issues associated with the twitter archive from WeRateDogs twitter feed. I also performed an exploratory analysis of the tweets and accompanying dataset that included a prediction for the dog breed referenced in each tweet.
