# FunData

A repository to store R scripts and Python Notebooks for data projects associated with the Udacity Data Analyst program. 

## Contents:
1. A weather analysis.  
2. An exploration into GapMinder data.   
3. Analyzing A/B test results with boostrap simulation and regression analysis. 

**weather_trends.Rmd** is a exploration into annual temperature in Miami, Florida. A moving average is used to compare annual temperature in Miami to the global average. The 
data for this analysis is in _RawData_.   

**GDP_ChildMortality_FemaleEducation_GapMinder.ipynb** (in the _InvestigateGapMinder_ folder, with raw data) is a mini data exploration project using Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.   

**AnalyzeABtestResults.ipynb** (in the _AnalyzeABTestResults_ folder, with raw data) was an assignment where I was tasked to analyze some A/B testing data using bootstrap simulation hypothesis testing and regression methods. I used numpy, pandas, statsmodels.api, and patsy.
