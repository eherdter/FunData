# FunData

A repository to store R scripts and Python Notebooks for data science projects I have worked on outside of my dissertation research. 

## Contents:
1. A project to identify customer segments for a mail order company in Germany.
2. A project to make insights about rider usage for the Ford GoBike bike share in California.
3. An analysis of the WeRateDogs Twitter feed.
4. An analysis of A/B test results using bootstrap simulation and regression analysis.
5. An exploration into GapMinder data using pandas and matplotlib.

1. **Identify_Customer_Segments.ipynb** is a project where I used unsupervised machine learning techniques to identify customer segments for a mail-order company in Germany. I performed extensive data exploration, cleaning, feature engineering and re-encoding before I applied Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Kmeans clustering. The data that I used for this project was provided by Udacity partners at Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics. Because they are proprietary, they are not included here.

2. **FordGoBikeData_AnalysisVisualization.ipynb** and **FordGoBikeData_VisualizationPresentaton** is an exploration of the Ford GoBike data collected in San Francisco in 2018. This .ipynb notebook will include any necessary wrangling and visualizations to gain insight about trends in rider usage. The slide deck will communicate the main findings of the exploration/analysis using data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn.

3. **wrangle_act.ipynb** (in the _WeRateDogs_Twitter_ folder, with raw data) was an assignment where I was tasked to address quality and tidyness issues associated with the twitter archive from WeRateDogs twitter feed. I also performed an exploratory analysis of the tweets and accompanying dataset that included a prediction for the dog breed referenced in each tweet.

4. **AnalyzeABtestResults.ipynb** (in the _AnalyzeABTestResults_ folder, with raw data) was an assignment where I was tasked to analyze some A/B testing data using bootstrap simulation hypothesis testing and regression methods. I used numpy, pandas, statsmodels.api, and patsy.

5. **GDP_ChildMortality_FemaleEducation_GapMinder.ipynb** (in the _InvestigateGapMinder_ folder, with raw data) is a mini data exploration project using Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
